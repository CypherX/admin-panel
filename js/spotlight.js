The works, done in and outside of class, are frequently on display throughout the school halls. Sightseers who venture through the town of Tanamuri will be greeted by several pieces decorating shops and stands. Everything from banners, window art, murals, installations, posters, and traditional prints help to add a unique flare to the area.<br /><br />The Takahashi Art Alliance supports students who are interested in learning from their peers and perfecting their artwork, taking on activities such as fundraising, commissions, and tutorial classes for various practices. It also sponsors many workshops on pen and ink, printmaking, painting techniques, and mixed media. Meetings are held bi-weekly, with several social gatherings throughout the school year.',
		interview:	"By Kyo Tamura<br /><br />When walking through the school and scouting out my next story for the school spotlight interviews, I came across the art room with miss Ayame Houdzuki and a few others hard at work. Being curious of her work, I decided to ask a few questions with her after she gave me permission to do so.<hr />Kyo: Hello there! I’m Kyo Tamura from Takabun, if you haven’t already heard of me. Let’s start off this interview shall we?<br /><br />Houdzuki adds one final touch to the glass she’s been working on and takes a seat in front of me.<br /><br />Ayame: Sounds wonderful to me, what exactly did you want to ask about?<br /><br />Kyo: Well the first thing I’d like to cover is that piece you just finished. What is that piece for if you don't mind my asking?<br /><br />Houdzuki laughs.<br /><br />Ayame: It’s not finished just yet! It still needs a little more work. It’s for a local fish market in town, they hired the club to do a few windows for them. It’s been so much fun to work on!<br /><br />Kyo: That’s great to hear. It already looks quite good though. It’s pretty easy to assume that it’s finished. The Art Alliance’s works are frequently on display in town, is the work difficult?<br /><br />She takes a moment to think it over, rubbing her chin slightly.<br /><br />Ayame: There are definitely ups and downs to it, but the work is great experience if you’re considering doing work professionally. The things we do are pretty popular with Tanamuri’s businesses and it gives our club all the funding we need.<br /><br />Kyo: So I take it that means you prefer your solo work?<br /><br />A light blush forms on her cheeks and she smirks a little.<br /><br />Ayame: Maybe, only because of how much of a slave driver the president is. If Sumiko wasn’t here to keep him in check I’m not really sure what would happen.<br /><br />Kyo: Perfectly understandable! I’ve heard several rumors myself. So is art a forte of yours?<br /><br />Ayame: Oh yes, very much so. It’s one of the very few things in this busy school that I can really sit down and relax doing. It’s been a big hobby of mine for years now. Well, that and stargazing.<br /><br />Her excited expression and quick response easily displays her passion for the subject.<br /><br />Kyo: Gazing at the stars at night and creating works of art by day! Do you ever sleep, Miss Houdzuki?<br /><br />Ayame: [laughs] Trust me, I get enough sleep! There’s just some things at night you don’t want to miss out on!<br /><br />Kyo: Seems like we got a bit sidetracked, let’s get back to the subject at hand. So how long did you spend on that window piece? 30 - 45 minutes?<br /><br />Her eyes widen a bit at my question.<br /><br />Ayame: Um... it was about 2 ½ hours. I think.<br /><br />Kyo: Oh my, that’s rather long isn’t it? Normally someone would have finished up a bit sooner don’t you think?<br /><br />Ayame: Well It’s a rather large piece...<br /><br />Kyo: I’ve noticed several other pieces of yours around the room. Is there a reason there aren’t any paintings on display?<br /><br />Ayame: That’s not something I...<br /><br />Kyo: That’s beside the point, forgive me. But where are the rest of the club members today? All out leaving you to do the rest of the work?<br /><br />Houdzuki seems a bit taken back by my questioning pace and from the other side of the room the Art Alliance VP, Sumiko Ueda, begins to approach us.<br /><br />Kyo: Oh, hello there Miss Vice-President! Care to answer a few ques-<br /><br />Sumiko: Not to be rude, Tamura. We have a deadline by tonight for this work and you’ve bothered Ayame long enough.<br /><br />Ayame: Oh, it’s fine. I was just getting a bit behind with all my questions.<br /><br />She rubs the back of her head lightly.<br /><br />Kyo: I still haven’t had a chance to interview you or the president either, Miss Ueda!<br /><br />Sumiko: Maybe another time, but we really need to get back to work. Have a nice day, Tamura.<br /><br />Quick as can be, I’m pushed out the door. Ayame perks up from behind Sumiko..<br /><br />Ayame: Sorry about all of this!"

		article:	'One of the editors of Takabun, Chihiro Yamada [center], passionately debates a new article with newspaper head Yuzuna Ito. Arguments are commonplace in the Journalism Club room, especially with Ms. Yamada.<br /><br />Takabun regularly coordinates with the Photography Club to publish articles on student life, campus activities, sports events, and creative pursuits such as short stories. Their fleet of writers and editors consistently produce quality pieces that are read by students campus-wide, and by residents of Tanamuri, where Takabun may also be picked up.',
		interview:	'By Kyo Tamura<br /><br />For the next of my series of Student Spotlight interviews, I managed to book our very own Journalism Club president and editor-in-chief, Yuzuna Ito.<br /><br />Things went well until she grew tired of speaking to me and hid under her desk.<br /><br />I was then pointed in the direction of editor Chihiro Yamada. Of course she was less than pleased at being interrupted in the middle of a meeting, and her shouted responses soon turned into a loud argument with our club president (during the height of the argument, my photographer stood on a desk and snapped the photograph you see to the left).<br /><br />I have been advised to not print anything that had been said, and my attempts to sneak it past editing were foiled.<br /><br />Finished arguing, Ms. Yamada flumps cross-legged into the chair afront of me. As I begin the interview, she fixes the knot holding her head wrappings in place.<hr />Kyo: Well, Yamada, I think we can forgo the introductions.<br /><br />She grunts (in primitive confirmation), glancing at her phone whilst I sort through my notes in an effort to find something I can ask. This would be a test of my journalism prowess.<br /><br />Kyo: Um, so how did you come to be part of the Journalism Club? Rather, how did you climb so high up the ladder in only a few weeks?<br /><br />Chihiro: I walked in.<br /><br />Kyo: I’m not sure I understand. You walked in?<br /><br />Chihiro: Yeah, not much more to it. Teach caught me without a club, so he dragged my scrawny as--butt in here. Yuzu saw me, soon as I got in, suddenly I got all this work to do.<br /><br />Kyo: So if I were a prospective member, I could simply walk in and Ms. Ito would hand me a high-level job?<br /><br />Chihiro: Yeah, prob\'ly. Not like it\'s a bad thing, mind, you get to skip class sometimes and get privy to a lotta things you wouldn\'t normally be privy to.<br /><br />Kyo: Oh, so in your own words, students should join the Journalism Club because they will be allowed to skip classes?<br /><br />Chihiro: Part of it, yeah.<br /><br />I am not one to kick a dog when it is down, so as a courtesy to her I allow the words time to sink in.<br /><br />Chihiro: Ah, s***, I prob\'ly shouldn\'t have said that, huh? You\'re gonna edit that part out, right?<br /><br />Kyo: Rest assured, Yamada, this will not go on the school website.<br /><br />Chihiro: Good, I’ll probably say lots’a stupid stuff you need to edit out.<br /><br />Kyo: Indeed. So, as an editor, what does your job encompass?<br /><br />I correct myself, realizing that she may not have understood me.<br /><br />Kyo: Ah, responsibilities: What do you do?<br /><br />Chihiro: Well, Kyo, I edit stuff.<br /><br />Kyo: I mean, could you maybe elaborate on your duties?<br /><br />Yamada scratches her head, no doubt struggling to conjure up an answer without profanities.<br /><br />Chihiro: Not sure what else you’re wanting me to say, s’not a complicated thing. I tell people that the stuff they write sucks and make it so it sucks less.<br /><br />Kyo: But isn’t the editor’s job to make good writing better?<br /><br />Chihiro: Hmm. That’s the kicker, right? I don’t know much myself but Yuzu says there’s no such thing as good writing, or you’re never really good until you know you can’t write for crap. Maybe it was something else. Anyway, a lotta writers end up offing themselves ‘cause they realize their life’s work was just a bunch of garbage. Uh--hang on--point is, I can’t make it good but I can make it not-bad, I think. I think that’s the point, anyway, she always rants on and on, I usually take that as a cue to disappear quiet as I can.<br /><br />Kyo: You seem to have a little understanding about how things work, why aren’t you a writer?<br /><br />Chihiro: (laughing) No amount of editing’s gonna fix my writing!<br /><br />Kyo: Alright, well let’s move on. What happens on a typical day at the Journalism Club?<br /><br />Chihiro: Whaddya think happens, idiot? You work here, too.<br /><br />Thankfully the alarm on her phone rings and my interviewee excuses herself, allowing me time to ask a few other club members about her. By her return, I have enough material with which to continue the interview.<br /><br />Kyo: Welcome back, Yamada. I did some short-order detective work while you were away and found out that this is your first year here, correct?<br /><br />Chihiro: Yeah.<br /><br />Kyo: What is your impression of the school, so far?<br /><br />She screws up her mouth and plays with the knot behind her head, which seems to have shifted in her absence.<br /><br />Chihiro: Kinda, it’s...hmm.<br /><br />Kyo: Do you need a minute?<br /><br />Chihiro: Nah. I’ll be honest, I haven’t thought much about it. Hit the ground running when I got here, y’know? I guess the grounds are pretty. And It’s too hot, ‘round here. Gotta stay inside, some days.<br /><br />Kyo: You like it cold, I see. Does that have anything to do with playing baseball?<br /><br />Chihiro: I dunno, does it?<br /><br />Kyo: Erm, what I was getting at was: colder weather is better baseball playing weather, which is why you like it, right?<br /><br />Chihiro: Oh, no, I just like it ‘cause I like it.<br /><br />Kyo: Well then, I’ll go ahead and move on to my next question: I found out that you’re a baseball fan. You know the team is always on the lookout for new players, why haven’t you joined?<br /><br />Chihiro: I dunno.<br /><br />Kyo: Well you don’t seem too terribly interested in writing as a hobby--<br /><br />Chihiro: Ah, you can cut the subtlety, I get what you’re getting at.<br /><br />She sits up, and once again I am in the path of her shouting.<br /><br />Chihiro: Hey Yuzu! Kyo says he wants my job, can we trade?<br /><br />Yuzuna chuckles, and when I turn to face her she breaks into a fit of laughter.<br /><br />Yuzuna: You serious?<br /><br />With a hanging head and a final period, the interrogation ends on laughter and slight humiliation. However, I am grateful for the experience gained in informal interviewing, and hope to give this method another try.<br /><br /><br /><br />Note from the editor: Don’t test me again, Kyo. I know where you sleep. I know you’re afraid of centipedes.'

		article:	"One of the most familiar locations involving the town of Tanamuri is the canal. Diverting the flow of melting water from the mountains, Tanamuri’s canal not only prevents the town from being flooded, but also creates a fantastic spot for the townspeople, visitors and the local students.<br /><br />One of the students commonly found enjoying the scenery and reprieve of the canal’s nature is Kasumi Nakano, pictured. She can often be seen walking along the canal towards her home or eating lunch beneath a willow tree. On rare occasions, she also treats passersby to her music.<br /><br />A talented musician, locals report that they enjoy her music and that it adds a special kind of touch to the town’s landmark. Much to our surprise when we interviewed her, she admitted she’s not a part of any music clubs and just prefers playing for the enjoyment of it.",
		interview:	"By Kyo Tamura<br /><br />After my brief chat with Nakano while walking along the canal, I asked if I could follow up the short conversation with a slightly longer interview. After agreeing, I asked where she’d be comfortable with an interview. I was then lead to Riposo Cafe, where we enjoyed an afternoon cup of coffee and began our interview.<hr />Kyo: I’m Kyo from Takabun, our school’s paper. Feeling ready for the interview?<br /><br />Nakano nods.<br /><br />Kyo: So, here we are, in Riposo Cafe. Is it alright if I call you Kasumi? I’d like this interview to be as relaxed as possible.<br /><br />Kasumi: Sure! That sounds nice. Stuff like this kind of makes me a little nervous, so I appreciate it.<br /><br />Kyo: No worries. So, Kasumi. What exactly do you enjoy the most about our town’s canal?<br /><br />Before she can answer, the cafe’s owner brings over a coffee for each of us. Mine, lightened with cream and sugar while Kasumi prefers not to add anything to hers but a teaspoon of sugar. Admittedly, I don’t expect her to prefer her coffee so strong.<br /><br />Kasumi: It’s really quiet and peaceful. I think that’s one of the big reasons I like it.<br /><br />Kyo: That’s pretty interesting, considering you’re always wearing those headphones of yours and listening to music. Plus, you’re a musician. Wouldn’t you like sound over silence?<br /><br />Kasumi: Music can be quiet. And you can find music in almost anything, if you listen hard enough.<br /><br />Kyo: I can see where you’re coming from on that. Are there any other things you like about the canal? Anything you’d change?<br /><br />Kasumi shakes her head, wearing a smile like it’s going out of style.<br /><br />Kasumi: I love it exactly the way it is. I really like nature, so I always feel comfortable around it. I grew up in Okinawa, so I’m really used to being around trees and nature.<br /><br />Kyo: Oh, is that why you’re always near that willow?<br /><br />A nod from Kasumi.<br /><br />Kasumi: It’s really pretty. We don’t have any trees like that back home, so I like being around it.<br /><br />Kyo: So, can I wager a guess and say that you enjoy the canal’s nature because it reminds you a little of home?<br /><br />Kasumi: S-sorta.<br /><br />Kyo: Sorry, you stuttered and I don’t think I heard you right.<br /><br />Kasumi goes quiet, sipping from her coffee and obscuring her face with the cup. When she lowers it, her face is tinted a bit red. I think her momentary stammer embarrassed her.<br /><br />Kyo: Well, I think that’s all. Maybe another time, you could play me a song on the canal?<br /><br />Kasumi: Yeah... maybe I will."

I ran into one recently at Wanisan Cajun, the local fusion-food eatery in town. As Isabelle-Zoe Hebert and Keiko Ishinomori were recently featured in a promotion for the school’s Work Study program, I’ve decided to interview them.<hr />I walk into the restaurant, greeted not with a smiling hostess, but a sleeping student. I think I share a class with him. Since he’s never awake, I don’t know his name, either.<br /><br />Keiko: Hey, take a seat. I’ll be there in a second.<br /><br />Keiko Ishinomori, the daughter of the owner, sits near the back of the restaurant in a booth. Soon after, Isabelle-Zoe Hebert walks out of the back... and immediately forces Keiko’s head down in an apologetic bow.<br /><br />Isabelle-Zoe: Sorry about her. Welcome to Wanisan Cajun, where all the food c’est vraiment magnifique.<br /><br />Keiko: Magnif--magnificka... it’s good stuff.<br /><br />I have no idea what was actually said, but Keiko seems to have passed along what it means.<br /><br />Isabelle-Zoe: Table for one, or will you...<br /><br />Kyo: I was hoping to interview you for the school newspaper.<br /><br />Isabelle-Zoe: Ah, my apologies. I’m not much of a good interviewee.<br /><br />Kyo: You don’t think you’re a good interviewee? An immigrant from Haiti who finds herself at a prestigious school in Japan? I could do a whole article about you.<br /><br />Isabelle-Zoe: Here, take a seat. I’m sure Ms. Ishinomori has tons to tell you; her dad is the owner of the place, that’s a good starting point.<br /><br />Keiko: Um, I guess I could.<br /><br />Isabelle-Zoe: Je pense qu'il serait peut-être un mal de tête.<br /><br />Keiko: Fine, go about whatever, Enter.<br /><br />I sit down with Keiko and proceed to have the silent treatment for a few seconds. As a daring reporter, I know a few ways to break the ice.<br /><br />Kyo: Folding silverware, huh? That’s got to be a decent time-waster here.<br /><br />Keiko: Oh, well yeah, it’s not the most fun part of the job.<br /><br />Keiko sits at a booth, folding silverware, putting knives, forks, spoons, and even metal chopsticks between napkins, rolling them up for later usage. I sit down with her.<br /><br />Kyo: My name’s Kyo, I’m sure you’ve heard about me. I’m one of the head writers at the school newspaper.<br /><br />Keiko: Nope. No idea who you are, Captain Ahab.<br /><br />Kyo: Well, I’d like to interview you about the work study program, if that’s okay.<br /><br />Keiko: Sure, I guess. I’m stuck here either way, might as well make things interesting.<br /><br />Kyo: Thanks. So, how is it working a cushy job for your dad? He doesn’t make you do anything really strenuous, does he? Probably bugs you about home stuff here too, right?<br /><br />Keiko: No, I really like working for my dad. He’s always been nice, letting me get away with stuff so long as I do the job. I mean, go look at the guy sleeping at the front.<br /><br />Kyo: Well, it does seem slow today. How’s business here? With the economy like it is, it must be easy to find people to do cheap labor.<br /><br />Keiko: Hey, my dad’s an internationally trained chef. And his assistant chef is--<br /><br />Kyo: No, no, I’m not insulting your abilities, I’m just pointing out everyone in the front is a student of our school. It must be financially smart. You’re dancing around the point, though.<br /><br />Keiko leans on an elbow. Her eyes glint with sinister intent that sends a shiver up my spine. I think I might’ve struck a chord with her.<br /><br />Keiko: Dancing around the point, am I? Hey Cousin! Whip up some of our wasaboudain for Lieutenant Dan, here!<br /><br />Isabelle-Zoe leans out from the back room, with a chastising glare. I feel safer when Ms. Ishinomori relaxes into her seat.<br /><br />Keiko: Fine, fine, I won’t use spicy food as a punishment.<br /><br />Kyo: Right. So, Ms. Ishinomori, how much of your time is taken by the work study program?<br /><br />Keiko: Oh, I usually get a 28 hour week in here.<br /><br />Kyo: Doesn’t leave much time for hobbies, huh?<br /><br />Keiko: Eh, I guess not. School and work each weekday, and one weekend shift. As long as I have Sunday mornings free, I’m good.<br /><br />Isabelle-Zoe: It’s the wrong reason to have Sundays free but at least she knows where to find her... peace, I’ll say.<br /><br />Before I can question why Sunday mornings are important, Ms. Hebert brings me a drink that I cannot identify, alongside a small platter of fried pastries.<br /><br />Isabelle-Zoe: This one of our fusion specialities; the drink is a Mint Julep Shake, and the tiny treats are beignets. They’re on the house. Oh, and obviously the Mint Julep Shake is virgin, but for adults, we do sell a...<br /><br />Before Ms. Hebert can continue her apparently perfected menu description, she’s stopped by Ms. Ishinomori’s laughter.<br /><br />Isabelle-Zoe: And what did you find so humorous?<br /><br />Keiko: Any time you say something like “virgin,” it feels off. Like that Hawking guy plugging dirty words into his Speak ‘n Spell or something.<br /><br />With a slight blush, Ms. Hebert once again fades into the back.<br /><br />Keiko: Go ahead, try them. They’re pretty delicious.<br /><br />A few bites of the pastries, a few sips of the shake, and I confirm that she’s right. Surprisingly she’s not joining me in them.<br /><br />Kyo: You want a bite?<br /><br />Keiko: No, sorry, doesn’t fit in my diet right now. “Superrrrrrrr Abs Time, starts now!”<br /><br />She says it with a tone and flourish that implies I should know the reference.<br /><br />Keiko: Oh, I’m the school’s sit-up champion from last year. I need to defend my title from time to time. Do you want to see my trophy? It’s near the front door.<br /><br />Ms. Hebert peers around the corner, scorning Ms. Ishinomori like she was her own daughter.<br /><br />Isabelle-Zoe: I’m sure he saw it near the door. Boasting is unbecoming.<br /><br />Keiko: What was that?<br /><br />Isabelle-Zoe: I will not raise my voice. I just commented that you are a little boastful. It is unladylike.<br /><br />Keiko: Sorry, can’t hear you, Port-au-Princess! Oh, you think a Akasan milkshake could work on the menu, Cousin? We could call it the “Haiti Milkshakey”.<br /><br />A male voice from the back room plainly states “no”, coupled with Isabelle-Zoe in agreement. I see another customer in the store shaking her head as well.<br /><br />Kyo: What’s “Akasan”?<br /><br />Keiko: It’s some sort of corn milkshake thing she’s told me about. Wanna try it? I’ll go start making it in the back. I think we’ve got popcorn somewhere.<br /><br />Kyo: No, no, don’t get up. I’ve gotta get going, anyway. Thanks, bye!<br /><br />Popcorn chunks in a milkshake? It certainly sounds exotic, but not something I would try. I do grab a few beignets on the way out, though."

The troublesome part was getting her away from the rest of the swim team long enough to conduct a proper interview. Thankfully my persistence earned me a chance to ask her a few questions, under the condition that we remain at the poolside. We moved to the bleachers as far from the noise of the pool-goers as we could manage, though it appeared her full attention hadn’t followed suit. <hr />Kyo: Alright, I’m Kyo of the Takabun and-<br /><br />Takeda: This’ll be quick, right?

Can never have enough, you know.<br /><br />Kyo: Oh, only practice.<br /><br />Takeda: Only?<br /><br />Kyo: So I believe I overheard the other team members saying you broke some sort of record?<br /><br />Her expression clearly brightens. It seems like the subject at hand has attracted her attention.<br /><br />Takeda: Nah, didn’t break it, got close though. Just one second under the national high school record for pools this size.<br /><br />Kyo: Impressive, though judging by the energy coming from the swim team one might think you’d already set a new goal for future swimmers.<br /><br />Takeda: [Laughs] Really they’re always like this. Practice doesn’t have to be all seriousness, ya know? We try to make it as fun as we can. <br /><br />Kyo: Practice must be fun if you’re so adamant about getting back to it. Although word around campus is you’ve missed a handful of practices too. Even some classes. Isn’t that a little odd?<br /><br />Takeda: E-Even I have other things to do now and then, ya know? I just work extra hard at every other practice to make up for lost time.<br /><br />Takeda hops to her feet and bounces down from the bleachers, cutting my next question short.<br /><br />Takeda: Sorry but I gotta get back. Still have practices to make up for!<br /><br />Kyo: Well I have a few more questions...<br /><br />I decide it best to consider this a small victory, having held her attention at all. It’s apparent that I won’t be getting it back any time soon as she jogs away to rejoin her team. As I stand to take my own leave I notice Takeda stop in her tracks and look to the ground, giving her head a slight shake to either side. I speak up.<br /><br />Kyo: Bit of water in the ears? <br /><br />Takeda: Stood up too fast. Or water. Ears. In them. Somethin’ like that. I’m alright!

For this week’s Student Spotlight, she’s the perfect candidate.<br /><br />Unfortunately, she’s also incredibly busy. Ms. Kita spends most if not all of her free time studying or with extra curriculars to help ensure her dream of being admitted into Tokyo University, and so I was unable to conduct an interview with her as originally scheduled. However, this reporter doesn’t like to miss an opportunity for good soft news, so he settled for the other girl in the spotlight’s photo — an infamously cheery girl and occasional journalism colleague by the name of Sarah.<br /><br />Who immediately declined the interview and walked away.<br /><br />Needless to say I was heartbroken until a day later, when she was then more or less “okay with it, I guess,” and that we should “just get this over with.”<br /><br />Miyo Kita was still unavailable.

Candid journalism at its finest.<br /><br />Sarah: That’s none of your business.<br /><br />Kyo: Nevermind that, then. Let’s begin the interview, shall we?<br /><br />Sarah: Fine.<br /><br />Kyo: Your name, please?<br /><br />Sarah: Sarah.<br /><br />Kyo: Sarah what?<br /><br />Sarah: No.<br /><br />Kyo: Sarah No?<br /><br />Sarah: This is going on the school’s website, right? So freaks out there on the internet can look up my personal information? I’m not for that. Make sure that you keep it off of there.<br /><br />Kyo: It’s not like anyone important goes to the school site, anyway.<br /><br />Sarah: Don’t care.<br /><br />This interview is going swimmingly.<br /><br />Kyo: Could you tell us a bit about yourself?<br /><br />She folds her arms and shoots me a cold look. I regret leaving my jacket in my room this morning.<br /><br />Kyo: Oh, come on! It’s an interview! Give me something, here!<br /><br />Sarah: I like long walks on the beach and romantic comedies.<br /><br />Kyo: You serious?<br /><br />Sarah: What do you think?<br /><br />Kyo: I think I’ve made a horrible mistake.<br /><br />Sarah: What was that?<br /><br />Kyo: Nothing, nothing. So, what do you do for fun?<br /><br />Sarah: Fun?<br /><br />Kyo: Yeah, how do you kill time?<br /><br />Sarah: How did you prepare for this interview?<br /><br />She puts her head down on her desk.<br /><br />Kyo: What’s your favorite part of Takahashi Academy?<br /><br />Sarah: The vending machines.<br /><br />Kyo: What.<br /><br />She picks her head back up.<br /><br />Sarah: It was a stupid question.<br /><br />Kyo: You’re impossible. I can’t use any of this!<br /><br />Sarah: You’re going to! That old man’s going to give me hell if you don’t.<br /><br />She sounds increasingly frustrated.<br /><br />Kyo: Old man?<br /><br />Sarah: Takahashi.<br /><br />Kyo: Right. Wait, the school’s Takahashi?<br /><br />Sarah: Are you an idiot?<br /><br />Kyo: So, what do you like to do on weekends?<br /><br />Sarah: What does anyone like to do on weekends?<br /><br />Kyo: I like to play jacks and skip rope.<br /><br />Sarah: You’re a child.<br /><br />Kyo: I also like hanging out with my friends, like any well adjusted teenager. Miss “No”, what do you like to do with your friends?<br /><br />There’s silence for a while. She looks everywhere in the room but at me.<br /><br />Kyo: Sarah?<br /><br />Continued silence.<br /><br />Kyo: Um... Your friends?<br /><br />Sarah: We’re done.<br /><br />She stands up quickly and storms out of the room, knocking a few desks out of place on her way, slamming the door behind her. I seem to have inadvertently angered her, and so this week’s interview comes to a close. Stay tuned for the next student spotlight!"

		article:	'Tomoe Takamura, another one of Takahashi\'s musical talents, spending her evening in the back of the music clubroom doing what she does best.<br /><br />The music club itself has been lacking as of late. Many members have moved on and interest has fallen, leaving only a few dedicated students to keep the club alive and its participants entertained. It\'s suggested that anybody with an interest should feel free to sit in on their sessions.<br /><br />Like all clubs at Takahashi, even with those without knowledge of the subject are welcomed all the same. Students are encouraged to explore their desires and interests here at Takahashi;  there\'s rarely a lack of activity after school hours so long as you know where to look.<br /><br />When she isn\'t putting on shows at local venues, Ms. Takamura can usually be found out and about around the cafeteria, playing with her dog Toru.',
		interview:	'By Kyo Tamura<br /><br />Music is an important part of life for plenty of people here at Takahashi; one such example would be Tomoe Takamura, Pianist and member of our school\'s music club.<br /><br />Having recently heard talk of her skill on the ivories, I decided to check her out during yet another one of my hunts for an interview. Needless to say, she turned out to be a prime candidate. I eventually found her practicing in the music clubroom, shortly before sunset. In retrospect, I probably should have looked there first. When I caught her attention and began to ask about having an interview, it was apparent she already knew who I was and what I was there for. Didn\'t know I was famous.<br /><br />Due to the nature of her "condition" as she put it, Ms Takamura conducted the following interview via cell phone. She intended to show me the screen throughout the interview, but that quickly became bothersome. I convinced her to switch to text messaging with little resistance.<hr />Kyo: It\'s safe to assume you\'re a fan of mine, seeing you already knew the drill before I was able to explain the situation?<br /><br />Tomoe: Not exactly, but I do know about you and Takabun.<br /><br />Kyo: And what exactly do you know about us?<br /><br />Tomoe: I know you like to go around asking all the pretty girls personal questions.<br /><br />Kyo: I don\'t particularly like it, but that is what I\'m supposed to be doing this week; yes.<br /><br />Tomoe: You don\'t like it? And just what is that supposed to mean?<br /><br />Kyo: All the running around, I mean! I have no problems talking with lovely ladies, such as yourself. Moving on, I hear you\'ve had a few engagements at local businesses? What\'s it like playing in front of an unfamiliar crowd?<br /><br />Tomoe: It\'s not that different from playing in front of the guys here. The only problem is that I can\'t get used to the pianos they give me.<br /><br />Kyo: And how does this affect your performance?<br /><br />Tomoe: It just feels awkward. I\'m told I sound fine, but it just doesn\'t click unless I have my regular set of keys. I almost had to cancel the last show because of how nervous I was getting. If that piano could speak, I\'m sure it would have said "I don\'t want to be played."<br /><br />Kyo: But you have no problem with the piano sitting in the corner there, by the window?<br /><br />Tomoe: No sir.<br /><br />Kyo: Interesting. Next question… How did you get into music?<br /><br />Tomoe: That\'s personal.<br /><br />Kyo: Was it before or after coming to Takahashi last year?<br /><br />She responds with only her eyes. I don\'t think I should pursue this line of questioning.<br /><br />Kyo: Okay, have it your way. How about the Jazz Club? My sources tell me there was a bit of drama that caused some people from your music club to split and start their own club. Care to elaborate?<br /><br />Tomoe: You\'re doing a very poor job of staying on my good side.<br /><br />Kyo: Well then… How about you take the lead? Is there anything you\'d like to say to our readers?<br /><br />Tomoe: Yeah, anybody with an interest in music should get their butts over here. It\'s me and a handful of others left after that split you were talking about.<br /><br />Kyo: Well, with the new semester just around the corner, I\'m sure you\'ll have a few new people in no time at all.<br /><br />Tomoe: Are we done yet? I’m not in a good mood any more.<br /><br />Kyo: You were in a good mood?<br /><br />Tomoe: Up until you interrupted me in the middle of practice, yes.<br /><br />Kyo: Hey, it took me quite awhile to pry you away from it. Are you always that focused while you\'re playing?<br /><br />Tomoe: I guess so. As long as it filters out any unwanted noise.<br /><br />Kyo: Like a charming journalist itching for a story?<br /><br />Tomoe: I don\'t think I\'ve ever come across one, so I wouldn\'t know.<br /><br />Kyo: That hurts, it really hurts.<br /><br />Tomoe: I can\'t imagine why it would.<br /><br />Kyo: Alright, Missy, how about any upcoming shows? Anything planned? Something my adoring public should be aware of?<br /><br />Tomoe: Nothing that I can think of right now. If you want, I could forward you details when something does come up?<br /><br />Kyo: That\'s alright. "Don\'t call me, I\'ll call you"<br /><br />Tomoe: Whatever you say, Mr. Reporter.<br /><br />Kyo: You\'re not too hot about this interview, are you?<br /><br />Tomoe: I really don\'t see the reason why you\'d pick me for this. I just wanna play music in peace.<br /><br />Kyo: Well, some people like hearing about that kind of thing.<br /><br />Tomoe: Still doesn\'t make sense. Why talk to me about it when you can just listen as I play?<br /><br />Kyo: That does sound like the better choice, but my tape recorder isn\'t exactly high definition.<br /><br />Tomoe: Speaking of quality, haven\'t you gathered enough data? If you\'re really that desperate, I can always talk about my dog.  <br /><br />Kyo: That\'s quite alright. I\'m about done here anyway.<br /><br />Tomoe: You sure? He\'s nice and fluffy.<br /><br />Kyo: …I\'ll be taking my leave now. It\'s been nice chatting with you.<br /><br />Tomoe: He loves to play fetch!<br /><br />High-tailing it out of the room and down the halls with my equipment in tow, I could hear laughter emanating from clubroom behind me, sending chills down my spine.<br /><br />Next time I do an interview, I\'m taking a friend with me. These one-on-one gigs are going to be the death of me.'
